# A Lox interpreter or two

This repo contains code written while following along with the amazing book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

To make things even more interesting (and since I don't want to use Java and I'm currently learning Go), I'm attempting to translate the code to Go in an interpreter called `golox`.

I'm not quite sure how this will work, but it's worth a shot.
It will certainly force me to truly understand the code, rather than just typing a copy of the book myself.
